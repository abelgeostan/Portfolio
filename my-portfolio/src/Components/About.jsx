          <p>
            Iâ€™m a B.Tech student at Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology, Kochi (CGPA: 8.35).
            I love building backend systems with Java & Spring Boot, deploying containerized services with Docker,
            and creating practical solutions like my YOLOv8-powered currency detection wearable for the visually impaired.
          </p>
      
      <p>
        I also run my own self-hosted Linux server for personal projects like StanDrive,
        and enjoy exploring cloud & DevOps tools.
